# vscode-settings

These settings are from my personal preference when switching from pycharm.

I have installed the following VSCode Extentions, which can be very useful for Cloudformation templates:

1. Indenticator
1. indent-rainbow
1. EditorConfig for VSCode
    - plus .editorconfig for any yaml files per repo
1. Sort lines
1. VSCode Tasks
    - plus tasks.json file per repo to lookup cfn types docs
1. vscode-cfn-lint
    - first, `pip install cfn-lint`
1. YAML Support by Red Hat (YAML) author is Red Hat
